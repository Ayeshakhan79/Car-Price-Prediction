# Car-Price-Prediction
Car Price Prediction is a web application built using Flask that predicts the price of a used car based on its features such as company, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven. The app uses a Linear Regression model trained on a cleaned dataset sourced from Kaggle.

---

**Features**

- Predict car prices using a pre-trained Linear Regression model.
- Interactive web interface with dropdowns for company, car model, year, and fuel type.
- Enter kilometers driven to get an estimated car price.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

**Tech Stack**

1. Backend: Python, Flask
2. Frontend: HTML, CSS 
3. Data Processing: Pandas, Numpy
4. Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
5. Model Persistence: Pickle

**Dataset**

- The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. The dataset was cleaned and pre-processed to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant features.
- The cleaned dataset used in this project is Cleaned_Car_data.csv.

**Model Used: Linear Regression**

The project uses a Linear Regression model to predict car prices.

**What is Linear Regression?**

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous numerical value (like car price) based on input features.
